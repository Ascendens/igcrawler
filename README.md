# Crawler for calculating amount of "img" tags on site

Sample crawler designed to calculate amount of "img" tags on whole site. Created for testing purposes only.

## Usage

There are predefined entry point "index.php" designed to be used from console:

```bash
php index.php http://www.example.com
```

Absolute domain URL should be used as argument. Crawling would be produced on domain, so no path is needed.
